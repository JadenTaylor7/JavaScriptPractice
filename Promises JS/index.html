    <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li>Check here for tips for each lab.</li>
        <li>Make sure your question isn't listed here if your professor is <b>Jaden Taylor. Jk not really.</b></li>
        <li>Keep this tab open in case a TA needs to message you on the help queue if they have trouble connecting with you.<br> 
            Make sure you don't have pop-ups blocked, or the chat message won't appear.
